iioengine
========= 

iio Engine is an open source JavaScript framework that streamlines the development HTML5 Canvas applications. This repo contains all published copies and working editions of iio Engine.

iio Engine 1.4.0 is the working copy of a push to finalize the upgrade. It will be modified frequently as it is tested and extended.

iio Engine 1.2.2 was the last stable deployment. You may wish to use that version (available at iioEngine.com) if you would like a better documented and more stable platform to work with.

## loading iio Engine
You can load the minified engine from a local folder or the iio Engine URL:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://iioengine.com/iioEngine.min.js"></script>

iio Engine has a debugging version with extra features:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://iioengine.com/iioEngine-debug.js"></script>

## building Source Files
To edit source files, use Grunt to re-build the engine. Grunt depends on nodejs and npm.

### installing nodejs and grunt
If you have brew you can install node easily

    brew install node

Then install the Grunt CLI.

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Install dependencies with npm.

    npm install

You can now run Grunt to build and minify iio.js

    grunt

Include the debug flag to build the debugging versions

    grunt debug
