iioengine
=========

The iio Engine is a JavaScript framework that streamlines the development of HTML5 applications. This repo contains the most recent version of the iio Engine core framework, all publicly available extension packages, and some demo application scripts.

The core platform is open source, and free to use and extend for any purpose.

Branches with new functionality will be merged only if they can run all of the demo applications included in this repo without any errors. 

Documentation for new functions will only be added to the API once a complete versioned update of the iio Engine is published. See the contributer' github notes or the iio Forums for tips on usage. 

Versioned updates may include structural changes to iio's existing architecture, and may alter or extend the usage of previously merged functions.
